# TripleTriadHelper
This is some experimental code that I ported over from some Java code I found several years ago. The ultimate goal would be to build some sort of thing that uses it but, hey... we can't all be winners now can we?

## Credits
Ryan Vogt (Poxnor) for the bulk of the original code and implementing the original Alpha-Beta algorithm.
Check him out.
